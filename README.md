## 🌟 Decentralized AI-Powered Task Management Platform 🌟

Welcome to the **Decentralized AI-Powered Task Management Platform**! 🚀 I’ve created this project to integrate cutting-edge technologies into a comprehensive task management system. This platform is designed to enhance productivity and collaboration within teams and individuals. Here’s what you can expect from this project:

## 🛠️ Features

1. **User Authentication and Authorization** 🔒
   - Secure login and registration using JWT (JSON Web Tokens).
   - Role-based access control (admin, user) to manage different levels of access.

2. **Task Management** ✅
   - Create, update, delete, and view tasks.
   - Assign tasks to team members.
   - Set deadlines and prioritize tasks.

3. **Machine Learning Integration** 🤖
   - Predict task completion times based on historical data using a regression model.
   - Recommend task priorities to optimize workflow.

4. **Blockchain Integration** ⛓️
   - Log task creation, updates, and completion using an Ethereum smart contract.
   - Ensure an immutable audit trail of all task-related activities.

5. **Real-Time Collaboration** 🌐
   - Use WebSockets to provide real-time updates and notifications for task changes.
   - Enable simultaneous collaboration on tasks by multiple users.

6. **Responsive Web Interface** 📱💻
   - Front-end developed with React.js for a modern and responsive user experience.
   - Accessible on both desktop and mobile devices.

7. **Documentation and Testing** 📝
   - Detailed setup, deployment, and usage instructions.
   - Unit and integration tests for key components to ensure reliability.

## 🚀 Getting Started

To set up and run the project, execute the following commands in sequence:
bash
1. Backend
cd backend
npm install  # Install backend dependencies
node server.js  # Start the backend server

2. Frontend
cd ../frontend
npm install  # Install frontend dependencies
npm start  # Start the React development server

3. Machine Learning
cd ../ml
pip install -r requirements.txt  # Install ML dependencies
python mlServer.py  # Start the ML server

4.  Blockchain
cd ../blockchain
npm install -g truffle  # Install Truffle globally
truffle compile  # Compile smart contracts
truffle migrate --reset  # Deploy smart contracts to the blockchain


# 💡 Use Cases
In the real world, this platform is ideal for:

1. Project Management: Organize and track tasks for personal or team projects, ensuring that deadlines are met and priorities are set.
2. Team Collaboration: Enhance communication and efficiency within teams with real-time updates and task management capabilities.
3. Predictive Planning: Use machine learning to estimate task completion times and prioritize tasks effectively, making project planning more accurate.
4. Secure Record Keeping: Leverage blockchain technology to maintain a transparent and secure log of all task-related activities, ensuring data integrity and trust.
